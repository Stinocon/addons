# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- A missing serial now lists the account's cameras in the log, each with its serial and model,
  instead of only rejecting the empty field. Enter the credentials, leave the serial blank,
  start once, and copy the serial the log prints. Works from a stored token too, so it still
  helps on two-factor accounts.
- README: a proper "Finding the serial" section, and a corrected note — the account password is
  not the camera verification code, and the verification code is not needed at all.

## 0.1.0

First release.

Serves EZVIZ camera video as MPEG-TS over HTTP, one port per camera, for go2rtc, Frigate
and anything else that speaks FFmpeg. Built for cameras that expose no RTSP at all — the
video door viewers and battery models, where EZVIZ never implemented it.

- One supervised proxy per camera, restarted with a growing, capped delay.
- The EZVIZ session is established once and kept on `/data`; it is verified before every
  proxy start and renewed when the cloud stops accepting it.
- Accounts with two-factor authentication are reported as such instead of failing in a
  restart loop, with the one-off command that works around it.
- Pinned to `pyezvizapi` 1.0.5.0, with the flags the service relies on checked at build time.
