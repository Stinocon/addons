# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release.

Serves EZVIZ camera video as MPEG-TS over HTTP, one port per camera, for go2rtc, Frigate
and anything else that speaks FFmpeg. Built for cameras that expose no RTSP at all — the
video door viewers and battery models, where EZVIZ never implemented it.

- One supervised proxy per camera, restarted with a growing, capped delay.
- The EZVIZ session is established once and kept on `/data`; it is verified before every
  proxy start and renewed when the cloud stops accepting it.
- Accounts with two-factor authentication are reported as such instead of failing in a
  restart loop, with the one-off command that works around it.
- Pinned to `pyezvizapi` 1.0.5.0, with the flags the service relies on checked at build time.
